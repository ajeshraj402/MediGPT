If you \nhave Medicare drug coverage (Part D) and your drug costs are high enough to \nreach this cap, you don\u2019t have to pay a copayment or coinsurance for Part D drugs \nfor the rest of the calendar year. You also have the option of spreading your drug \ncosts across monthly payments throughout the year. Go to page 83. \nManaging your mental health and wellbeing\nMedicare covers expanded mental health care, like intensive outpatient program \nservices in certain locations and services from marriage and family therapists and \nmental health counselors (page 46). During your yearly \u201cWellness\u201d visit, your health \ncare provider can also use a health risk assessment to better understand your social \nneeds and refer you for appropriate services and support (page 55).\nMore resources for caregivers\nMedicare covers additional caregiver support, like training that helps your caregiver \nbetter care for you (page 33) and relief when they\u2019re caring for family members in \nhospice care (page 27). Also, some people living with dementia and their caregivers \nmay be able to get more support though a new pilot program (page 35).\nPostal Service Health Benefits Program\nU.S. Postal Service employees, retirees and their families now get coverage through \na new benefits program instead of through the Federal Employee Health Benefits \nprogram. Go to page 89.\nChanges to telehealth coverage\nYou can get telehealth services at any location in the U.S., including your home, \nthrough March 31, 2025. Starting April 1, 2025, you must be in an office or medical \nfacility located in a rural area for most telehealth services. However, you can still get \ncertain telehealth services (like for mental and behavioral health) in your home no \nmatter where you live.

The final amount is rounded to \nthe nearest $.10 and added to your monthly premium. The \u201cnational base \nbeneficiary premium\u201d may increase or decrease each year. If that happens, the \npenalty amount you pay may increase or decrease. After you get Medicare \ndrug coverage, the plan will tell you if you owe a penalty and what your \npremium will be. \nExample: \nMrs. Martinez is currently eligible for Medicare, and her Initial Enrollment \nPeriod ended on July 31, 2021.

Her drug \ncoverage was effective January 1, 2024.\n2024\nSince Mrs. Martinez was without creditable prescription drug coverage from \nAugust 2021\u2013December 2023, her penalty in 2024 was 29% (1% for each of \nthe 29 months) of $34.70 (the national base beneficiary premium for 2024) \nor $10.06. Since the monthly penalty is always rounded to the nearest $0.10, \nshe paid $10.10 each month in addition to her plan\u2019s monthly premium.\nHere\u2019s the math:\n.29 (29% penalty) \u00d7 $34.70 (2024 base beneficiary premium) = $10.06\n$10.06 rounded to the nearest $0.10 = $10.10\n$10.10 = Mrs. Martinez\u2019s monthly late enrollment penalty for 2024"}, {"page_num": 85, "text": "85\nSection 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)\n85\n2025\nIn 2025, Medicare recalculated Mrs. Martinez\u2019s penalty using the 2025 base \nbeneficiary premium ($36.78).

You can provide proof that supports your case, like information about \nprevious creditable prescription drug coverage. If you need help, call your plan. \nWhich drugs are covered?\nAll plans must cover a wide range of prescription drugs that people with \nMedicare take, including most drugs in certain \u201cprotected classes,\u201d like drugs to \ntreat cancer, HIV/AIDS, or depression. Information about a plan\u2019s list of covered \ndrugs (called a \u201cformulary\u201d) isn\u2019t included in this handbook because each plan \nhas its own formulary. Before joining a plan, be sure to review its formulary. \nA plan can make some changes to its drug list during the year if it follows \nguidelines set by Medicare. For example, your plan may change its drug list \nduring the year because drug therapies change, new drugs are released, or new \nmedical information becomes available. Your plan coinsurance may increase \nfor a particular brand name drug or generic drug when the manufacturer raises \nthe price. Your copayment or coinsurance may increase when a plan starts to \noffer a generic version of a brand name drug or biosimilar version of an original \nbiological product, but you continue to take the brand name drug or original \nbiological product. In some cases, the plan may cover a drug for one health \ncondition but not another.\nNote: Medicare Part B covers a limited number of outpatient prescription drugs. \nGo to page 39 for more information. Medicare drug coverage (Part D) includes \ndrugs, like buprenorphine, to treat Opioid Use Disorders. It also covers drugs, \nlike methadone, when prescribed for pain (but not covered under Part D to treat \nOpioid Use Disorders). \nPart D typically places drugs into different levels called \u201ctiers\u201d on their \nformularies. Drugs in each tier have a different cost. For example, a drug in a \nlower tier will generally cost you less than a drug in a higher tier. \nWhat happens if my drug is in a higher tier? \nIn some cases, if your drug is in a higher tier and your prescriber (your doctor or \nother health care provider who\u2019s legally allowed to write prescriptions) thinks you \nneed that drug instead of a similar drug in a lower tier, you or your prescriber can \nask your plan for an exception to get a lower coinsurance or copayment for the \ndrug in the higher tier.

When this \noccurs, plans will likely have alternative drugs on their list of covered drugs \n(formulary) for the other medical conditions the drug is approved to treat. \nContact your plan or visit their website to find out about prior authorization \nrequirements.\n\u2022 Quantity limits: Limits how much of a drug you can get at a time. \n\u2022 Step therapy: You may need to try one or more similar, lower-cost drugs \nbefore the plan will cover the prescribed drug. \n\u2022 Opioid pain medication safety checks at the pharmacy: Before the \npharmacy fills your prescriptions, your plan and pharmacy perform \nadditional safety checks, like checking for drug interactions and incorrect \ndosages. \n \nThe opioid safety checks also include checking for possible unsafe \namounts of opioid pain medications, limiting the day\u2019s supply of a first \nprescription for opioids, and limiting the use of opioids at the same time \nas benzodiazepines (commonly used for anxiety and sleep). Opioid pain \nmedicine (like oxycodone and hydrocodone) can help with certain types \nof pain, but have risks and side effects (like dependence, overdose, and \ndeath). These can increase when you take opioids with certain other drugs, \nlike benzodiazepines, anti-seizure medications, gabapentin, muscle relaxers, \ncertain antidepressants, and drugs for sleeping problems. Check with your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you have questions about risks or side effects.\n\u2022 Drug Management Programs: Medicare drug coverage (Part D) has \nprograms in place to help you use opioids and benzodiazepines safely. \nIf your opioid use could be unsafe (for example, due to getting opioid \nprescriptions from multiple doctors or pharmacies, or if you had a recent \noverdose from opioids), your plan will contact the doctors who prescribed \nthem for you to make sure they\u2019re medically necessary and you\u2019re using \nthem appropriately."}, {"page_num": 87, "text": "87\nSection 6: Medicare drug coverage (Part D)\n87\nIf your plan decides your use of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines \nmay not be safe, the plan will send you a letter in advance.
